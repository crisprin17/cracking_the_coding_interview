    "# Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph organizes items in an interconnected network.\n",
    "Each item is a **node** (or vertex). **Nodes** are connected by **edges**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representing links.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect to other things. Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, routers and ethernet cables, or Facebook users and their friendships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling challenges.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most graph algorithms are **O(n*lg(n))** or even slower. Depending on the size of your graph, running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed or undirected\n",
    "**In directed graphs**, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. \n",
    "**In undirected graphs**, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclic or acyclic\n",
    "A graph is **cyclic** if it has a cycle—an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or edges that connects back to itself. \n",
    "Graphs without cycles are **acyclic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted or unweighted\n",
    "If a graph is **weighted**, each edge has a \"weight.\" The weight could, for example, represent the distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.\n",

    "We're using a queue instead of a list because we want an efficient first-in-first-out (FIFO) structure with O(1) inserts and removes.\n",
